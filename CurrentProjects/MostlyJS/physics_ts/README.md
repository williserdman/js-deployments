This is a small game that was inspired by a popular mobile game. It was built using THREE.js and the cannon physics engine to ensure that the particles fall realistically. The game is written in TypeScript and is fully playable. The goal is to stack as many boxes as possible (tap when they're aligned) the parts of the boxes that are not aligned fall off, making it more challenging - my high score is 27.
