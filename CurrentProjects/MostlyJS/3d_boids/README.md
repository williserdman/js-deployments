# Demo
See code above, [link to results](https://amazing-douhua-119f06.netlify.app/). My implementation of Craig Reynold's artificial life simulation. I created a 3d version using his original 3 rules:
- Seperation
- Alignmen
- Cohesion

It was made in 3 dimensions using three.js. In the results (linked above) the upper window is a far away view of the simulation, with Boids constrained into a defined area. The bottom window is the perspective of a single Boid which I thought would be interesting.
